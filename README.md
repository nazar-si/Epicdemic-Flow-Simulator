# Epidemic Flow in Python
Epidemic Flow SIR-modeling in Python

![](efip.png)

This little project was inspired by the video on the 3Blue1Brown channel:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs

We also recommend to check the papers listed in the description of this video.

So, main.py - is file for running this program

Requires such libraries as:<br/> • numpy<br/> • pygame<br/> • opensimplex</br>

Just run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For some reason I fineshed only UI for that thing. But anyway you may check my science paper (in progress) on that thing: 
[Researching epidemic flow and social behaviour in virtual environment](./VEFE.pdf)
